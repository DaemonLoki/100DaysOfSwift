# 100DaysOfSwift

This is my repository for the [100DaysOfSwift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/) challenge created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws).

All projects were either inspired by him or at least heavily influenced and instructed.

If you want to learn more about Swift I highly recommend his wonderful site 
[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) with tons of well-written 
and educative articles and learning materials.

Also if you enjoy his work he has written a lot of books on Swift which you can 
find [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store) (this is not sponsored in any
way, I just think it's highly recommendable).
